Out of the box Windows installs with a few SAPI voices, plus additional "Mobile voices".

These "Mobile" voices, although they don't seem to be available for standard Windows programs (just for Universal Apps) are also available in TeaseLib on Windows. 

You also might want to install additional voices that are available from Microsoft - some of them with really good qquality - here's how:

Sources for TTS voices that can be used with TeaseLib on the Windows platform:

- already installed "Mobile" voices that come with the initial language of your Windows installation.

- voices installed by adding additional language packs in "Time & Langauge"->"Region & Language".
	° not all language packs contain speech resources (tested: de, en-au, en-ca, en-in, en-uk, en-us, fr)
	° After downloading Speech resources for the language, you can see additional voices in "Time & Langauge"->"Speech"
	° Downloading the Speech resources also installs Speech Recognition for that language
	° Some voices are installed as "SAPI" voices, others only as "mobile"

	- Speech Server Runtime 11 plus any Speech Server TTS voices for for Microsoft Speech Server (Version 11):
	° Some of the Speech Server 11 voices are also available as part of a Windows 10 language pack - check before install
