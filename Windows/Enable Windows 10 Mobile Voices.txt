Out of the box Windows installs with a few SAPI voices, plus additional "Mobile voices". However, the "mobile" voices aren't available for standard Windows programs, just for Universal Apps.

But you can add additional voices, and also activate them for use with standard Windows programs, here's how.

Sources for additional TTS voices:
- already installed "Mobile" voices that come with the initial language of your Windows installation.
- voices installed by adding additional language packs in "Time & Langauge"->"Region & Language".
	° not all language packss contain speech resources (tested: de, en-au, en-ca, en-in, en-uk, en-us, fr)
	° After downloading Speech resources for the language, you can see additional voices in "Time & Langauge"->"Speech"
	° Downloading the Speech resources also installs Speech Recognition for that language
	° Some voices are installed as "SAPI" voices, others only as "mobile"
- installing Speech Server Runtime 11 plus any Speech Server TTS voices for for Microsoft Speech Server (Version 11):
	° Some of the Speech Server 11 voices are also available as part of a Windows 10 language pack - check before install

However these voices arn't available via the classic Text-To-Speech panel directly. However you can enable them using the instructions below.

    !!!WARNING!!!
    This involves manual edits to your registry. If you mess it up, don't blame me. Do at your own risk.

    Step 1 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Install the Speech Platform v11

    a) go here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27225
    b) click "Download"
    c) select the "x64_SpeechPlatformRuntime\SpeechPlatformRuntime.msi"
    d) run the installer (duh :P)

    Step 2: --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Get the alternate voices

a) go here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27224
b) click "Download"
c) select the voice files you want. They are the ones that have "TTS" in the file name. 
d) run the installers for each voice you've downloaded

    Step 3: --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Extract the registry tokens

a) Open Regedit
b) Under - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Speech Server\v11.0\Voices - right click the "Tokens" folder and export. Save this file to your desktop as voices1.reg so it will be easy to find later.
b) Under - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Speech Server\v11.0\Voices - right click "Tokens" and again export it, again to the desktop. Call it voices2.reg.

    Step 4: --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Edit the voices1/2 files for M$ Speech Server:

-------- for "mobile voices from language packs --------
c) enter \Speech_OneCore\ into the "Find What" field
d) enter \Speech\ into the "Replace With" field
e) click "Replace All"
f) Save File
g) Repeat a-f with the Voices2.reg file

    Step 5: --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Merge the new Registry files into your registry

a) double click to "run" both Voices1.reg and Voices2.reg
b) Click "Yes" when it prompts

    You should now have access to the new voices in Voice Attack, and in the Windows TTS options menu.
    This process may also work with other voice packs.
